## Project Description
The overall purpose of this assessment is to evaluate your ability to apply functional programming and object oriented programming concepts in R. There are two parts to this assignment. The first part compares different functional programming techniques and benchmarks their performance. The second part uses object-oriented programming techniques to define a class to represent longitudinal data and provide a set of functions for interacting with such data.
